1.0	BACKGROUND

NASA IS EXPLORING ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES TO REDUCE THE OVERALL COST AND WEIGHT OF LIQUID HYDROGEN (LH2) CRYOTANKS. COMPOSITES ARE MATERIALS THAT ARE COMBINATIONS OF TWO OR MORE ORGANIC OR INORGANIC COMPONENTS. ONE MATERIAL SERVES AS A ""MATRIX,"" WHICH IS THE MATERIAL THAT HOLDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER, WHILE THE OTHER MATERIAL SERVES AS REINFORCEMENT, IN THE FORM OF FIBERS EMBEDDED IN THE MATRIX.  A CRYOTANK IS A CONTAINER THAT CAN STORE VERY COLD LIQUIDS, IN THIS CASE LIQUID HYDROGEN.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE NEW AND INNOVATIVE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION TO DESTINATIONS BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT SUCH AS THE MOON, NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS, AND MARS.  THE FOCUS OF THIS INITIAL 1-YEAR EFFORT IS TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED FOR A HEAVY LIFT LAUNCH VEHICLE (SIMILAR TO THE SATURN V ROCKET USED TO LAUNCH APOLLO MISSIONS) BETWEEN 8.4 METERS AND 10.0 METERS IN DIAMETER.  THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL SERVE MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS INCLUDING NASA, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD), AND COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE COMPANIES.  FUTURE SPIN-OFF CAPABILITIES MAY INCLUDE LH2 CORE STAGES (1ST AND TYPICALLY LARGEST SECTION OF A ROCKET), IN-SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS (A PROPULSION SYSTEM IS A MACHINE THAT PRODUCES THRUST TO PUSH AN OBJECT FORWARD), ON-ORBIT PROPELLANT DEPOTS (A CACHE OF PROPELLANT THAT IS PLACED ON AN ORBIT ABOUT THE EARTH OR ANOTHER BODY TO ALLOW SPACECRAFT TO BE FUELLED IN SPACE), AND LIQUID OXYGEN (LOX) CRYOTANKS.  

OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN A VARIETY OF COMPOSITE CRYOGENIC TANK PROGRAMS AT NASA AND THE AIR FORCE.  EACH OF THESE PROJECTS HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS BUT THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES THAT HAVE MADE NASA RELUCTANT TO INCORPORATE THEM.  ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES THAT NASA FACES WHEN INCORPORATING ANY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS BRIDGING THE MID TECHNICAL READINESS LEVEL (TRL AS DEFINED BY HTTP://ESTO.NASA.GOV/FILES/TRL_DEFINITIONS.PDF) GAP BETWEEN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND INCORPORATION INTO FLIGHT VEHICLES (ROCKETS).  THE INTENT OF THIS CONTRACT EFFORT IS TO PUSH THE TECHNICAL MATURITY OF COMPOSITE TANKS FURTHER BY BUILDING ON THE DEVELOPMENTS OF RECENT PROGRAMS.  NASAS MOST RECENT COMPOSITE CRYOTANK WAS DEVELOPED UNDER THE NEXT GENERATION LAUNCH TECHNOLOGY (NGLT) PROJECT.  THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES AND DEMONSTRATION (CCTD) ALSO HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON NEW IMPROVEMENTS DEVELOPED BY COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE INTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IR&D) ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.  BUILDING ON PAST COMPOSITE CRYOTANK SUCCESSES AND EVALUATING NEW STATE OF THE ART MATERIALS THROUGH EQUIVALENCY TESTING SHOULD ALLOW NASA TO REALIZE CONSIDERABLE MASS AND COST SAVINGS.

IN FISCAL YEAR 2011, NASA PLANS TO BEGIN A PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON INNOVATIVE IDEAS ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES OR RADICALLY ALTERING OUR CURRENT APPROACHES TO SPACE SYSTEMS.  GAME CHANGING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (GCDP) ARE INTENDED TO BE CAPABILITY-ORIENTED AND DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT METHODS THAT ADVANCE DISCIPLINE OR CORE KNOWLEDGE.  THE GOAL OF THE PLANNED GCDP IS TO MATURE TECHNOLOGIES IN PREPARATION FOR POTENTIAL SYSTEM LEVEL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGH SIGNIFICANT GROUND-BASED TESTING AND/OR LABORATORY EXPERIMENTATION.  NASA WILL MANAGE THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WITHIN THESE GUIDELINES.

ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING THE NEXTGEN IS IMPROVING SAFETY WHILE ALSO IMPROVING EFFICIENCY IN MORE CROWDED SKIES. NEW AIRCRAFT WILL USE NEW OPERATIONS; PEOPLE WILL HAVE NEW ROLES.  TO SAFELY INTEGRATE THOSE NEW REQUIREMENTS, THE AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM CONDUCTS RESEARCH TO:  IDENTIFY SAFETY CONCERNS THAT COULD EMERGE FROM A MORE DECENTRALIZED FUTURE AIRSPACE SYSTEM; EXPLORE WHETHER DATA MINING OF DIGITAL FLIGHT DATA AND VOLUNTARILY SUBMITTED REPORTS CAN REVEAL VEHICLE ISSUES AS WELL AS FLIGHT OPERATIONS ISSUES; STUDY AND IDENTIFY CAUSES OF ENGINE ICING; IMPROVE ON-BOARD SYSTEMS THAT MONITOR OVERALL VEHICLE HEALTH TO MAKE MAINTENANCE MORE EFFICIENT; ANALYZE SYSTEM-WIDE SAFETY PROPERTIES OF VEHICLES AND OPERATIONS AND THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF SOFTWARE-INTENSIVE SYSTEMS; DEVELOP ADVANCED FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR NEW AIRCRAFT; ANALYZE HOW COMMUNICATION NETWORKS ACCOMMODATE BOTH HUMAN-AUTOMATION AND HUMAN-HUMAN INTERACTIONS; AND TEST THE SAFETY AND DURABILITY OF NEW MATERIALS PROPOSED FOR FUTURE VEHICLES.  THE PROGRAM BUILDS UPON THE UNIQUE SAFETY-RELATED RESEARCH CAPABILITIES OF NASA TO IMPROVE AIRCRAFT SAFETY FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT, AND TO OVERCOME AIRCRAFT SAFETY TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CONSTRAIN THE FULL REALIZATION OF THE NEXTGEN.

RECOVERY - SMAAATAV TASK TITLE:  HWB MULTI BAY TEST ARTICLE DESIGN AND TOOLING
1.0	BACKGROUND:
NASA CREATED THE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION ERA PROJECT TO EXPLORE AND DOCUMENT THE FEASIBILITY, BENEFITS AND TECHNICAL RISK OF VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  TODAY'S CURRENT GENERATION OF AIRCRAFT HAS BENEFITTED FROM NASA INVESTMENTS IN AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH THAT HAVE IMPROVED FUEL EFFICIENCIES, LOWERED NOISE LEVELS AND LESSENED HARMFUL EMISSIONS. ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE, MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE NATION'S AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WILL EXPAND BY A FACTOR OF TWO OR THREE WITHIN THE NEXT TWO DECADES, POTENTIALLY INCREASING AVIATION'S CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE ERA PROJECT WORKS TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM THAT COULD RESULT FROM SUCH AN EXPANSION. 
AMONG THE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE EXPLORED IN THE ERA PROJECT ARE THE FOLLOWING:
	UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS THAT HAVE HIGHER LIFT TO DRAG RATIO, REDUCED DRAG AND REDUCED COMMUNITY NOISE;
	DRAG REDUCTION THROUGH LAMINAR FLOW;
	ADVANCED COMPOSITE STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS FOR WEIGHT REDUCTION;
	LOW NOX COMBUSTORS; AND
	PROPULSION AND AIRFRAME INTEGRATION FOR NOISE REDUCTION AND FUEL-BURN IMPROVEMENTS.
THE ERA PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING FUEL BURN, EMISSIONS, AND NOISE.  THE PROJECT WILL EXPLORE AND DOCUMENT THE FEASIBILITY, BENEFITS AND TECHNICAL RISK OF VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES IDENTIFIED TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  THIS RESEARCH DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES TO ENSURE CONTINUED GROWTH IN AIR TRANSPORTATION.
THE PRIMARY STRUCTURAL CONCEPT BEING DEVELOPED UNDER THE ERA PROGRAM IN THE AIRFRAME TECHNOLOGY ELEMENT IS THE PULTRUDED ROD STITCHED EFFICIENT UNITIZED STRUCTURE PRSEUS DESIGN. THE PRSEUS DESIGN APPROACH IS PART OF THE ERA EFFORT TO ADDRESS FUEL BURN C02 EMISSIONS BY REDUCING THE WEIGHT OF ADVANCED STRUCTURES.  REDUCING FUEL BURN REDUCES THE NEED TO USE RESOURCES AND REDUCES POLLUTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE APPROACH MOVES FROM SAFE-LIFE TO FAIL-SAFE DESIGN WITH A LIGHTWEIGHT COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.

NASA'S AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM IS CONDUCTING RESEARCH DIRECTED AT IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF CURRENT AND FUTURE AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM. THE RESEARCH FOCUS IS ON THE WAY VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED, BUILT, OPERATED, AND MAINTAINED, AND IS ORGANIZED INTO FOUR PROJECT AREAS: 1 INTEGRATED VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT, 2 INTEGRATED INTELLIGENT FLIGHT DECK, 3 INTEGRATED RESILIENT AIRCRAFT CONTROL, AND 4 AIRCRAFT AGING AND DURABILITY.  THIS RESEARCH STATEMENT OF WORK SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE INTEGRATED VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT IVHM PROJECT WHICH IS CONDUCTING RESEARCH INTO VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL DETECT, DIAGNOSE, PREDICT, AND MITIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING FLIGHT.  ADVERSE EVENTS INCLUDE THOSE THAT ARISE FROM SYSTEM, SUBSYSTEM, OR COMPONENT FAULTS OR FAILURES DUE TO DAMAGE, DEGRADATION, OR ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS SUCH AS TURBULENCE, ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, AND LIGHTNING.   
IN PARTICULAR, THIS EFFORT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A VEHICLE-LEVEL REASONING SYSTEM VLRS THAT WILL LOOK ACROSS ALL OF THE VEHICLE SUBSYSTEMS PROPULSION, FLIGHT SYSTEMS, AIRFRAME, AND SOFTWARE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER AN ADVERSE EVENT HAS OCCURRED, DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE, PREDICT THE EFFECT ON THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO MITIGATE THE EVENT AS APPROPRIATE.  THE VLRS MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF COMPONENT, SUBSYSTEM, AND VEHICLE LEVEL MODELS WHICH WOULD REPRESENT CONNECTIVITY AND POTENTIAL CAUSAL CHAINS OF FAILURE. SIMILARLY, PHYSICS-BASED MODELS OF DAMAGE PROPAGATION FOR CERTAIN SUBSYSTEMS SUCH AS THE AIRFRAME OR ACTUATORS MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR INCLUSION IN THE VLRS.  VLRS TECHNOLOGIES WILL PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO ENABLE CONDITIONED-BASED MAINTENANCE CBM FOR AIRCRAFT.  WITH CBM, MAINTENANCE ACTIONS ARE PERFORMED ONLY WHEN THERE IS AN ANTICIPATED NEED, AS OPPOSED TO REGULARLY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE ACTIONS.  IN ORDER TO ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR MAINTENANCE, A CBM SYSTEM WILL USE INFORMATION AND DATA DERIVED FROM ONBOARD SENSORS AND SUPPORTING INSTRUMENTATION SUCH AS THOSE UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN NASA'S IVHM PROJECT AS WELL AS MAINTENANCE LOGS FOR THE VEHICLE.

1.0	BACKGROUND:
 
NASA CREATED THE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION ERA PROJECT TO EXPLORE AND DOCUMENT THE FEASIBILITY, BENEFITS AND TECHNICAL RISK OF VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  TODAY'S CURRENT GENERATION OF AIRCRAFT HAS BENEFITTED FROM NASA INVESTMENTS IN AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH THAT HAVE IMPROVED FUEL EFFICIENCIES, LOWERED NOISE LEVELS AND LESSENED HARMFUL EMISSIONS. ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE, MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE NATION'S AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WILL EXPAND BY A FACTOR OF TWO OR THREE WITHIN THE NEXT TWO DECADES, POTENTIALLY INCREASING AVIATION'S CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE ERA PROJECT WORKS TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM THAT COULD RESULT FROM SUCH AN EXPANSION. 
AMONG THE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE EXPLORED IN THE ERA PROJECT ARE THE FOLLOWING:
	UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS THAT HAVE HIGHER LIFT TO DRAG RATIO, REDUCED DRAG AND REDUCED COMMUNITY NOISE;
	DRAG REDUCTION THROUGH LAMINAR FLOW;
	ADVANCED COMPOSITE STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS FOR WEIGHT REDUCTION;
	LOW NOX COMBUSTORS; AND
	PROPULSION AND AIRFRAME INTEGRATION FOR NOISE REDUCTION AND FUEL-BURN IMPROVEMENTS.
THE ERA PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING FUEL BURN, EMISSIONS, AND NOISE.  THE PROJECT WILL EXPLORE AND DOCUMENT THE FEASIBILITY, BENEFITS AND TECHNICAL RISK OF VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES IDENTIFIED TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  THIS RESEARCH DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES TO ENSURE CONTINUED GROWTH IN AIR TRANSPORTATION.
THE PRIMARY STRUCTURAL CONCEPT BEING DEVELOPED UNDER THE ERA PROGRAM IN THE AIRFRAME TECHNOLOGY ELEMENT IS THE PULTRUDED ROD STITCHED EFFICIENT UNITIZED STRUCTURE (PRSEUS) DESIGN.  THE PRSEUS DESIGN APPROACH IS PART OF THE ERA EFFORT TO ADDRESS FUEL BURN (C02 EMISSIONS) BY REDUCING THE WEIGHT OF ADVANCED STRUCTURES.  REDUCING FUEL BURN REDUCES THE NEED TO USE RESOURCES AND REDUCES POLLUTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE APPROACH MOVES FROM SAFE-LIFE TO FAIL-SAFE DESIGN WITH A LIGHTWEIGHT COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.  PRSEUS REPRESENTS A NEW CONCEPT IN COMPOSITE DESIGN THEORY AND MANUFACTURING METHODS.  IT IS A CONSCIOUS PROGRESSION AWAY FROM CONVENTIONAL LAMINATED AND BONDED ASSEMBLIES TOWARD LARGER ONE-PIECE PANEL DESIGNS WITH SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS AND DAMAGE-ARREST INTERFACES SUCH AS STITCH ROWS AND TEAR STRAPS.  IT FOCUSES ON A NEW STRUCTURAL CONCEPT THAT INTEGRATES SKIN, STRINGERS, AND FRAME ELEMENTS INTO A SINGLE LARGE PANEL IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY CURED (OR CO-CURED) IN ONE HIGH-TEMPERATURE CURE CYCLE.  THE RESULTING STRUCTURE IS A NOVEL SOLUTION FOR ADDRESSING THE DEMANDING FUSELAGE LOADING REQUIREMENTS INHERENT IN A PRESSURIZED SHAPED VEHICLE LIKE THE HYBRID WING OR BLENDED WING BODY (HWB/BWB) CONCEPT.  THE PRSEUS CONCEPT BUILDS UPON, EXTENDS, AND TAILORS THESE STRUCTURAL TECHNOLOGIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMANDING CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH VEHICLES WITH SHAPES AND LOAD PATHS DIFFERENT FROM TODAYS TRADITIONAL WING AND CIRCULAR FUSELAGE STRUCTURES.
AS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRSEUS TECHNOLOGY, EXPERIMENTATION ON DAMAGED STRUCTURE IS REQUIRED TO EXPLORE THE BEHAVIOR OF PRSEUS PANELS SUBJECTED TO LOADING CONDITIONS STIPULATED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) FOR CERTIFICATION.  DISCRETE SOURCE DAMAGE IS A TYPE OF DAMAGE THAT CAN OCCUR IN FLIGHT AND THE AIRCRAFT MUST BE ABLE TO SAFELY LAND WITH DAMAGE AS SEVERE AS THE FAILURE OF A PRIMARY LOAD-CARRYING MEMBER SUCH AS A FRAME OR STRINGER.  IN SUCH A SITUATION, THE LOSS OF A STRINGER MUST NOT IMMEDIATELY LEAD TO THE LOSS OF ADDITIONAL STRINGERS THROUGH CRACK GROWTH, AS OFTEN HAPPENS WIT",ORANGE,HUNTINGTON BEACH,CA,48,926472048,UNITED STATES,UNITED STATES,FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION,,SUBJECT TO MULTIPLE AWARD FAIR OPPORTUNITY,NO SET ASIDE USED.,FAIR OPPORTUNITY GIVEN,COST PLUS FIXED FEE,DELIVERY ORDER,OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION,135025133,THE BOEING COMPANY (5694),5301 BOLSA AVENUE,,HUNTINGTON BEACH,CALIFORNIA,926472099,UNITED STATES,48,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,OTHER THAN SMALL BUSINESS,1,1,"-$14,191.87",$0.00,$0.00

1.0	BACKGROUND:
NASA'S AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM IS CONDUCTING RESEARCH DIRECTED AT IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF CURRENT AND FUTURE AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM.  THE RESEARCH FOCUS IS ON THE WAY VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED, BUILT, OPERATED, AND MAINTAINED, AND IS ORGANIZED INTO FOUR PROJECT AREAS  
1. INTEGRATED VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT, 2. INTEGRATED INTELLIGENT FLIGHT DECK, 3. INTEGRATED RESILIENT AIRCRAFT CONTROL, AND 4. AIRCRAFT AGING AND DURABILITY.  THIS RESEARCH STATEMENT OF WORK SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE INTEGRATED VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT IVHM PROJECT WHICH IS PURSUING RESEARCH DIRECTED AT DEVELOPING CONCEPTS, TOOLS, TECHNIQUES, AND METHODOLOGIES FOR ASSESSING THE HEALTH OF FLIGHT-CRITICAL AIRCRAFT SOFTWARE.  THIS EFFORT IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE IVHM SOFTWARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT SUB-ELEMENT WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN VERSION 2.0 OF THE IVHM TECHNICAL PLAN1.  SOFTWARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO PERFORM THE FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL DETECT, DIAGNOSE, PREDICT, AND MITIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING FLIGHT. ADVERSE EVENTS INCLUDE THOSE THAT ARISE FROM SYSTEM, SUBSYSTEM, OR COMPONENT FAULTS OR FAILURES DUE TO DAMAGE, DEGRADATION, OR ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS SUCH AS TURBULENCE, ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, AND LIGHTNING. FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH PROVIDES THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A TECHNOLOGY BASE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE STATED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.  WHILE DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSTICS, AND MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED IN HARDWARE SYSTEM AND COMPONENTS, APPLICATION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO SOFTWARE IS A NEW CONCEPT RECENTLY ADDED TO THE IVHM RESEARCH PORTFOLIO. 
THE POTENTIAL SAFETY BENEFITS AFFORDED BY THE ENVISIONED SOFTWARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONCEPT LED TO THE 2008 NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT TOPIC 5.1 SOFTWARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES HTTP://WWW.AERONAUTICS.NASA.GOV/NRA.HTM WHICH SPECIFICALLY TARGETS THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOUNDATIONAL TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES TO ENABLE THE DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS, AND MITIGATION OF ERRORS AND RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY SOFTWARE IN ON-BOARD SYSTEMS. 
THESE IN-PROGRESS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE ADDRESSING MANY OF THE FOUNDATIONAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY SOFTWARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO PLANNING FOR THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION SUCH TECHNOLOGY MAY INTRODUCE TO AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATION FOR SOFTWARE-BASED SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT.  THIS TASK SEEKS TO CHARACTERIZE THE IMPACT THAT NEW SOFTWARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES MAY HAVE ON CURRENT AND EMERGING AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES.  ESTABLISHING THIS CHARACTERIZATION IS VITAL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL INFUSION OF SOFTWARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES INTO CIVIL AVIATION.  
2.0 	SCOPE OF WORK:
