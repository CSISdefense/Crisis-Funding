## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ReadInFiles}


# mtcars xlsx file from demoFiles subfolder of package XLConnect
c1xls <- system.file(file.path("Data","FY2016","c1.xlsx"), 
                             package = "XLConnect")

# Load workbook
wb <- loadWorkbook(c1xls)

# Read table 'MtcarsTable' from sheet 'mtcars_table'
c1data <- readTable(wb, sheet = "FY 2015", table = "FY 2015")


c1<-read.xlsx(file.path("Data","FY2016","c1.xlsx"),
                     na.strings=c("NULL","NA"),
                     header=TRUE)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
